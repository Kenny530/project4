<p class= "vil"> <br> The teams you are looking at above are products of teams losing on purpose in order to get all of the best draft prospects, and from there they will be able to attract all of the best free agents and load up the roster.<br> Many of these teams either had a rich past or some of these teams had a past so forgettable they should be abolished from the league.</p>

<ol class="stand">
<li> Los Angeles Dodgers	91-71	.562 </li>
<li> Washington Nationals	95-67	.586 </li>
<li> Texas Rangers	95-67	.586 </li>
<li> Boston Red Sox	93-69	.574 </li>
</ol>
</center>
<p class="lb"> From what you can see above is what the records of the teams who have been dominating the past few years in the MLB. <br> The statistics and records of the teams show how unfair overpowered teams can be in the league. <br> The Dodgers have been a household team in the playoffs since 2013 because they have tanked in the past and gotten players like Joc Pederson, Cody Bellinger, and Clayton Kershaw. <br> This can be seen with the Red Sox as well with Mookie Betts, and Andrew Benitendi. If tanking still continues in the league pretty soon we will have an extremly unbalanced league. </p>
